############## HOW TO RUN ##############

## UPDATE DATABASE (migration files already included)
> In the terminal:
  dotnet ef database update

## RUN DOTNET
> In the terminal:
   dotnet watch run




## OPTION 1: VIEW DIRECTLY IN BROWSER - SWAGGER
> In browser:
  http://localhost:5000/swagger
  "Try It Out"
  "Execute"
  [results appear in Response Body below]




## OPTION 2: VIEW IN POSTMAN (postman.co)
> In central pane:

  ## VIEW ALL RECORDS [GET]
    > In first dropdown (look for "Send" button, and then go to far left of the same row):
        Select "GET" from dropdown (probably already selected)
    > In central field, right of "GET":
        http://localhost:5000/api/products
    > Hit "Send" Button
    > [results appear in Response Body below]

  ## VIEW ONE RECORD [GET/{id}]
    > In first dropdown (look for "Send" button, and then go to far left of the same row):
        Select "GET" from dropdown (probably already selected)
    > In central field, right of "GET":
        http://localhost:5000/api/products/{id}
        ({id} is an integer - an item's database key.  Try http://localhost:5000/api/products/1 if unsure)
    > Hit "Send" Button
    > [result appears in Response Body below]

  ## ADD A RECORD [POST]
    > PRELIMINARY STEP: for convenience, generate a template first, by copying the result of a GET/{id} query above
    > In first dropdown (look for "Send" button, and then go to far left of the same row):
        Select "POST" from dropdown
    > In central field, right of "POST":
        http://localhost:5000/api/products
    > In row of options below top field:
        select "Body"
    > In new row that appears just below
        select "raw" (NOTE: an empty box will appear below.  This will be used shortly)
    > In "Text" dropdown that appears in same row
        select "JSON"
    > In the empty box that appeared when clicking "raw" (above)
        - Paste in the text copied in the preliminary step above.
        - Delete the first line that starts with "id" : 
        - Edit any value for the other lines to create your new item (each line has a ":", dividing the field on its left from the valule on its right)
        - Make sure there are still opening and closing curly braces around your entry ({})
    > Hit "Send" Button
    > [result appears in Response Body below] (note your new item now has an "id" value in the first line)
    > Bonus 1: perform a GET/{id} above, using the id of your new item, and it will appear in the result
    > Bonus 2: perform a GET above, and your new item will appear as the last item in the result

  ## CHANGE ONE RECORD [PUT/{id}]
    > PRELIMINARY STEP: for convenience, copy the result of a GET/{id} query above, so you'll have everything for editing the record and preserving the rest of it
    > In first dropdown (look for "Send" button, and then go to far left of the same row):
        Select "PUT" from dropdown
    > In central field, right of "PUT":
        http://localhost:5000/api/products/{id}
        ({id} is an integer - an item's database key.  Try http://localhost:5000/api/products/1 if unsure)
    > In row of options below top field:
        select "Body"
    > In new row that appears just below
        select "raw" (NOTE: an empty box will appear below.  This will be used shortly)
    > In "Text" dropdown that appears in same row
        select "JSON"
    > In the empty box that appeared when clicking "raw" (above)
        - Paste in the text copied in the preliminary step above.
        - Edit any value for the other lines to create your new item (each line has a ":", dividing the field on its left from the valule on its right)
        - Make sure there are still opening and closing curly braces around your entry ({})
    > Hit "Send" Button
    > [result DOES NOT appear in Response Body below]
    > TO SEE THE RESULT...
        - make note of the record's id number
        - change the first dropdown from "PUT" back to "GET"
        - add /{id} to the end of the URL field to the right of the "GET" dropdown (replace {id} with the id record's number)
        - Hit "Send" Button
        - [your edited item should now appear in the Response body]

  ## DELETE A RECORD [DELETE/{id}]
    > PRELIMINARY STEP: find/confirm the id of the record you want to delete.
        - FIND: perform a GET query above, and search the results for the record in question.  Make note of the "id" value
        - CONFIRM: if you think you know the id, perform a GET/{id} query above, and check that the result matches your expectations
    > In first dropdown (look for "Send" button, and then go to far left of the same row):
        Select "DELETE" from dropdown
    > In central field, right of "DELETE"
      http://localhost:5000/api/products/{id}
      ({id} is an integer - an item's database key.  Try http://localhost:5000/api/products/1 if unsure)
    > Hit "Send" Button
    > [your deleted item WILL appear in the Response body]
    > Run a GET/{id} to confirm that it is deleted (the result should be an empty Response body)
